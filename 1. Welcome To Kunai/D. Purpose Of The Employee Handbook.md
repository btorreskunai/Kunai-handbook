# Purpose Of The Employee Handbook

## For Kunai
We are using this handbook to provide a consistent set of policies and procedures. We also use this handbook to describe working conditions and the workplace behavior and contributions we expect from employees.

We believe that by putting forth a shared approach to addressing workplace issues, we have the best potential to create a harmonious, fair, employee and employer supportive workplace. We also use this handbook to set guidelines around appropriate behavior for the workplace.

The handbook also allows us to ensure employees are informed about actions and behaviors that will warrant disciplinary action up to and including employment termination.

## For The Employee

With our handbook, employees will always know what is expected of them at work. They know how Kunai will address and apply the policies and procedures of the business and what they can expect from Kunai.

Employees will know how Kunai will address problems and complaints and have a reasonable expectation that employees with similar issues will receive similar treatment. They share a knowledge base with the rest of the employees, too, and know what is important for the business.

Finally, the handbook serves as a reference guide to a great deal of information that employees need at work.
