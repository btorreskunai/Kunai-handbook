# Orientation

Purpose 

The welcoming of new employees is a collaborative effort that includes Human Resources (HR), the hiring manager, and other teams throughout Kunai. Preparing for new hires and providing appropriate guidance and information during the first several days of employment will help ensure success. This short-term orientation process is not a replacement for onboarding of employees through their specific role and department, which is a more detailed and longer process with the team members in their department.

## First Day

HR will meet with the new hire at the start of his or her first day of work to review any applicable new hire information and processes including, but not limited to, reviewing new-hire paperwork, preparing key cards, reviewing benefits and payment information, and reviewing the new hire presentation and employee handbook. Key administrative policies to be covered on the first day include:

- Anti-harassment 
- Pay periods
- Training requests
- Computer/Internet
- Emergency evacuation
- Workplace injuries

Hiring managers should be well-prepared for an employee's first day at work and should welcome new hires with the following:

- Workstations set up with appropriate equipment and supplies.
- Introductions to co-workers and a tour of the facilities.
- Lunch with the hiring manager.
- An overview of the department's mission, values and key policies.

## Team Introductions

The hiring manager will coordinate introductions and/or a department overview with a management representative from each Kunai department about the purpose of and functions within his or her department.
