# Referral Bonuses

We are growing quickly and one of the main reasons we have found ourselves in this exciting position is because of our people - the calibre of talent and their cultural fit within Kunai. In fact, our team’s working style and attitude is what makes us successful. It’s really important that we preserve and cultivate this. As such, we want to grow our team as much as we can through our existing team. This will empower you to have a say in who joins us, where possible, by recommending people through our Referral Program. This will formalize - and monetize (for you) - the process of you recommending talented and likeminded individuals. 

Here’s how it works:

- Think about who in your personal and professional network would be a good fit for the type of work we do at Kunai.
- Avoid selecting any members of staff at our clients.
- Have a conversation with them about Kunai, using your own experience. If you need some ideas on how to position us, we’ll share some materials with you. 
- If they would be interested to speak to Kunai further, log their details here https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5tJsFnyZUfUwozutVJl8aT_BkMsuZ4W0F6v0xOjvF0GKQAQ/viewform?usp=sf_link and let HR know. Don’t log details of people that you haven’t explicitly talked to about Kunai.

Your work is done! We will use this input to create a pipeline of talent and match individuals to specific projects and needs. 

We value your time and know that engaging people requires time and effort. As our appreciation of your time, if we hire someone that you recommendeded, we will compensate you with a referral bonus of $1,500. If your referral is hired permanenttly after 3 months, we will give you another $1,500. The 3-month component does not apply to referred contractors because of the temporary nature of the work.

Recruitment resources and tools can help us and will be used alongside referrals, but you truly know who would thrive at Kunai and many of you have fantastic networks of talent you could tap into. Let’s take Kunai to the next level!
