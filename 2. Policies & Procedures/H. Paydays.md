# Paydays

Regular employee paydays occur twice per month, or semi-monthly, on the **15th of the month** and on the **last day of the month**. The last day of the month will fluctuate between the 28th and the 31st depending on the month. If either of the regular paydays falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a bank holiday, then payday will be moved up to the previous business day.

Your pay will be deposited directly via electronic transfer of funds to a financial organization such as a bank, savings and loan, or credit union. Each payday an Earnings Statement will be available for viewing on your [TriNet] (https://sso.trinet.com/auth/cdcservlet?realm=sw_hrp&RequestID=A1AC439A1DCC028B085484A96A3F8BAB9F679C64D4C9CCF84C796DD3B1BE006C&MajorVersion=1&MinorVersion=0&ProviderID=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinet.hrpassport.com%3A443%2Famagent%3FRealm%3D%2Fsw_hrp&IssueInstant=2019-04-03T13%3A09%3A56Z&goto=https%3A%2F%2Ftrinet.hrpassport.com%2F%3Fampostpreserve%3D920ecd6a-a544-9a48-b54c-8e711a642277) homepage.
