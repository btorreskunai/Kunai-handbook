# Contractor Payments

All contractors are expected to submit their invoices monthly on time and per the below process. Please review the process and reach out to tarun@kun.ai if you have any questions.

1. All invoices are due by the 23rd of each month.
2. The invoice should bill for the current month in total (including remaining days).
3. The invoice should be sent to both ap@kun.ai *and* kunai@officengine.com.
4. Invoices should be attached to the email and in pdf format.
5. Here's an [invoice template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XCRmlXzBB6kVcgchMR0HOKQnpyW5sJ03CRl38YDooy0/edit?usp=sharing) if you need one. Save a copy in your own Google Drive.

**Invoices that are sent late and/or not to both email addresses will have a payment delay.**
