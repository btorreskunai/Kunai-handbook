# Expense Reimbursement

Kunai asks that you keep track and report on those reimbursable expenses that you pay yourself. We reimburse employee expenses that are related to:

- Business travel
- Education and training (See [Employee Development](https://github.com/btorreskunai/Kunai-handbook/blob/master/2.%20Policies%20%26%20Procedures/L.%20Employee%20Development.md))
- Upon approval, outings with business partners or colleagues

Not all travel expenses are reimbursable. For example, we will pay for your transportation to an airport for work-related travel, but not to a museum for a personal visit. Before traveling for business, contact AP@kun.ai to clarify which expenses are reimbursable within your particular trip.

Please keep receipts for all reimbursable expenses over $100. You can submit your expenses using this [Expense Report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nFF0Iq64ZzTE606yu5MiYmtbSvmjJtYa3ujGtwudYqA/edit?usp=sharing) within 1 week after the date of each expense. Please save your Expense Report as a PDF and email it, along with a copy of your receipt, to AP@kun.ai. If approved, you will receive your reimbursement within two weeks.
