# Expense Reimbursement

There are some expenses that we will pay directly on your behalf (e.g. hotel rooms for work-related travel.) But, we ask you to keep track and report on those reimbursable expenses that you pay yourself. We reimburse employee expenses that are related to:

- Business travel
- Education and training (See section 
[Upon approval, outings with business partners or colleagues]
Not all travel expenses are reimbursable. For example, we will pay for your transportation to an airport for work-related travel, but not to a museum for a personal visit. Before traveling for business, contact HR to clarify which expenses are reimbursable within your particular trip.

Please keep receipts for all reimbursable expenses. You can submit them to your manager [through our expense software] within [three months] after the date of each expense. If your manager approves your expenses, you will receive your reimbursement within [two] pay periods [by check.]
