# Meal & Rest Breaks

The California Labor Code sets forth the following requirements for meal and rest periods for non-exempt employees.

## Meal Breaks

Employees who work more than five (5) hours in a day are entitled to a minimum thirty (30) minute meal break. However, an employee may agree to waive that meal break if s/he will not work more than six (6) hours in the day.

In addition, employees who are working more than ten (10) hours in a day must also be given a second thirty (30) minute meal break. But the employee may waive this second meal break if his/her work day will be no longer than twelve (12) hours *_AND_* s/he did not waive the first meal break.

## Rest Breaks

Rest breaks/rest periods are also required under California labor regulations.

The length of required rest periods must be at least ten (10) minutes for each four (4) hours, or substantial fraction thereof, that the employee will work in the day.

These rest breaks must be counted as time worked and must be paid time. They must also be in the middle of the employee's work period, to the extent that this is a practicable.

But rest periods are not required for employees who work less than three and a half (3 1/2) hours in a day.
