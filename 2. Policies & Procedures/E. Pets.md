# Pets

We love pets. Who doesnâ€™t? However, it can become stressful for people to work with your lovely python slithering around (the one that eats mice, not SQLite). We would accommodate that on a case-by-case basis. Please email Human Resources at HR@kun.ai to get your pet approved. Keep in mind that you are responsible for keeping the space clean and supervising the behavior of your eventually-approved pet.
