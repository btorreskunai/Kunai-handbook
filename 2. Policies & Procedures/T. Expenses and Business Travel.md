# Expense Reimbursement

Kunai asks that you keep track and report on those reimbursable expenses that you pay yourself. We reimburse employee expenses that are related to:

- Business travel
- Education and training (See [Employee Development](https://github.com/btorreskunai/Kunai-handbook/blob/master/2.%20Policies%20%26%20Procedures/L.%20Employee%20Development.md))
- Upon approval, outings with business partners or colleagues

Not all travel expenses are reimbursable. For example, we will pay for your transportation to an airport for work-related travel, but not to a museum for a personal visit. Before traveling for business, contact AP@kun.ai to clarify which expenses are reimbursable within your particular trip.

Please keep receipts for all reimbursable expenses over $100. You can submit your expenses using this [Expense Report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nFF0Iq64ZzTE606yu5MiYmtbSvmjJtYa3ujGtwudYqA/edit?usp=sharing) within 1 week after the date of each expense. Please save your Expense Report as a PDF and email it, along with a copy of your receipt, to AP@kun.ai. If approved, you will receive your reimbursement within two weeks.

## Per Diem for Business Travel

What is per diem? Well, at its most basic, it’s a Latin phrase meaning, “for each day.” But at a practical level it refers to a daily allowance for employees traveling for business. Examples of items the IRS deems eligible for a per diem include:

- Lodging (although Kunai will book this for you)
- Meals
- Laundry, dry cleaning, and pressing of clothes
- Room service
- Fees and tips for service providers, including baggage handlers and food servers

Note that per diems don’t include transportation to and from each location. Kunai will can either make travel arrangements for our employees, or we will let employees book their own travel and then reimburse them.

According to the IRS recommendations, we will pay the suggested amount for a high-cost area: 

**$71 per day for meals and incidentals.** 

Please use your own money up front and then submit an expense reimbursement request along with all receipts. **Failure to submit the receipts and an expense report will subject your per diem money to regular taxes.**
