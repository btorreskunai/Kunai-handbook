# Wage Garnishments

A wage garnishment is an order from a court or a government agency directing a company to withhold a certain amount of
money from an employee’s paycheck and send it to a specified person or agency. Wages can be garnished for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to:

- To pay child support
- Spousal support or alimony
- Tax debts
- Outstanding student loans
- Money owed as a result of a judgment in a civil lawsuit. 

If Kunai is instructed by a court or government agency to garnish an employee’s wages, the employee will be notified of the
garnishment at once. Please note: Kunai is legally required to comply with these orders. If you dispute or have concerns about the amount of a garnishment, contact the court or agency issuing the order.
