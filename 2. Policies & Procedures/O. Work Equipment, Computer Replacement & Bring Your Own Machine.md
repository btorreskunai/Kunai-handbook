# Work Equipment & Bring Your Own Machine (BYOM)

## Work Equipment

All Company property – including desks, storage areas, work areas, lockers, file cabinets, computer systems, office telephones, mobile telephones, printers, etc. – must be used properly and maintained in good working order. Employees who lose, steal, or misuse Company property may be personally liable for replacing or repairing the item.

The Company reserves the right, at all times and without further notice, to inspect and search all Company property for the purpose of determining whether this policy or any other policy of the Company has been violated, or when an inspection and investigation is necessary for purposes of promoting safety in the workplace or compliance with state and federal laws. These inspections may be conducted during or outside of business hours and in the presence or absence of the affected employee. To protect the Company’s legitimate business interests, the Company reserves the right to question and inspect or search any employee or other individual entering or leaving Company premises, with or without notice. The inspection or search may include any packages or items that the individual may be carrying, including briefcases, handbags, knapsacks, shopping bags, etc. The individual may be requested to display the contents of any packages and/or turn out his or her pockets, etc., in the presence of a representative of the Company, typically a management employee of the same gender.

## Computer Replacement Policy

The increasing number of requests for computers has created the necessity for a company-wide policy, which follows:

Kunai recognizes its responsibility to provide our employees with the appropriate tools for them to fulfill their responsibilities. To that end, Kunai will provide an appropriate computer for all permanent emoployees who need one for the performance of their duties. Generally this will be a laptop computer, but in some instances a desktop computer may be more appropriate than a laptop. That request and determination should be made via the employee's manager/PM. 

Employees should not expect Kunai to provide them with more than one computer. 

Employees will be eligible to request new computers four (4) years from their last computer-comissioned date. In certain instances a new computer may be needed sooner. To request a new computer, please complete the [Hardware Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScb8OpEhvZxV-cfLf79En2wBniru1IbPRPrX3ZWXM60X3ROeg/viewform?usp=sf_link) for management to review your request. 

## Bring Your Own Machine (BYOM)

If you decide to use your own machine, there is one major rule you need to follow: 

**Full Disk Encryption**

You are required to fully encrypt your computer's hard drive and any drives containing client information and/or information related to Kunai's business. Please provide evidence in the form of a screen shot to Human Resources at HR@kun.ai on a yearly basis.
