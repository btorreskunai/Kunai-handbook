# Brand Guide

This should be your reference for all things Kunai: fonts, logo usage, colors, etc.

## 1. Fonts

If you have an Adobe login, access the following links to download our primary Brand fonts:
- [Warnock Pro](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/warnock?red=a) (Activate display, regular, regular italic, and regular bold)
- [Titling Gothic FB](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/titling-gothic-fb) (Activate normal, normal medium, normal Seminole, normal bold, normal semibold)

If you do not have an Adobe login, use [Cormorant Garamond and Rubik](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Kyipct8P995SoHwrQ6yXQGBzPI5rCKHU) as the alternative.

## 2. PPT Templates

There is a new PPT template in the [Presentation Kit](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1NyiJQ0Z6o9jqgGHuG6wQgHSRA-LV2kjd) folder. This template contains slide examples with our brand messaging (if needed for one of your decks), our primary fonts, and more examples of slide layouts.  Also, the “new slide” templates still exist under the drop down when you add a new slide.

There is a new folder under Presentation Kit labeled ["Example Decks"](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/15t3s8v1GdJ0va2-eM2xy5cXldKeAN2eK) that contains - you guessed it - examples of other decks for reference. Please note that some of these decks contain proprietary Client information and should only be used for reference.

Please note that we are working towards a more comprehensive deck template for the BD and Product teams.

# 3. Branded Google Doc

When you open a new Google doc, go to the “Template Gallery” in the upper right and toggle to Kunai. This will display the Kunai branded Google doc template.

# 4. Creative Request Form

Have a design request (i.e. forms, documents, templates)? [Submit design requests here](https://forms.gle/9rkvbJtjg6HUegue6). These requests are sent directly to Sterling R. and Giana R. Once they’ve had a chance to assess the ask, they’ll follow up with an estimate of when it will be ready.
