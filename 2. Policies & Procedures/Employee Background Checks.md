# Employee Background Checks

Our employee background check policy refers to our guidelines for investigating our job candidates’ backgrounds as part of our hiring process. Background checks help us get insight into candidates’ backgrounds, ensure we hire reliable employees, and screen candidates convicted of serious criminal behavior. Background screening is not used as a way to disqualify someone's application or reduce the number of applicants for a position. Background checks are meant to reinforce a hiring decision and ensure candidates who have been selected for a job are suitable. If candidates refuse to go through background screening, they will be informed that they will not be considered for the position.

## Scope

This employee background check policy applies to candidates who go through our company’s hiring process. It may also apply to internal candidates who are being considered for a promotion or transfer to a new project.

## Policy Elements

Background checks may include:

- Criminal records
- Credit reports
- Drug testing
- Verification reports (e.g. identity, previous employment, education, SSN)
- Driving records
- Reference checks

All candidates aren’t required to pass every type of background check we offer before our company hires them. Each position has its own requirements. For example, driving records may be relevant to field reliable salespeople, but not to hire software engineers. The basic background screening includes: 

- SSN Trace + Associated Counties
- Sex Offender List Search
- National Criminal Databases Search

Local laws may prohibit or restrict certain types of background checks. We’ll comply with legal guidelines at all times.

Criminal record checks are essential if candidates are interviewing for positions where they will:

- Represent our company and deal with our clients or stakeholders
- Have access to sensitive and confidential information
- Handle money and finances

## Kunai’s Responsibilities:

- Inform candidates that a background check is required in the position’s job advertisement 
- Ask candidates to provide written permission before conducting a background check and let them know how long the process will take
- Hire a reputable and reliable background check provider 
- Give candidates information they need to dispute a report or address any issues a background check turns up

## What to Make of Negative Findings:

Criminal records don’t automatically disqualify candidates from the hiring process, unless they are convicted of serious criminal acts (e.g. sexual assault.) We will judge the substance of criminal records according to these criteria:

- Number of criminal convictions for the same offense
- Time elapsed from the most recent criminal conviction
- How the criminal conviction relates to the position

Note that HR/hiring managers will consider convictions, not arrests, when reviewing a candidate’s background check.
