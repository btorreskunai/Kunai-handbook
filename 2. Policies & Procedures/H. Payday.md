# Payday

Regular employee payday is semi-monthly on the **15th of the month** and on the **last day of the month**. The last day of the month will fluctuate between the 28th and the 31st depending on the month. If either of the regular paydays falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a bank holiday, then payday will be moved up to the previous business day.

Your pay will be deposited directly via electronic transfer of funds to a financial organization such as a bank, savings and loan, or credit union. Each payday an Earnings Statement will be available for viewing on your TriNet homepage. This statement lists your gross salary and any deductions taken from it. Common deductions include, but are not limited to, Federal and State income tax, retirement and Social Security contributions, and insurance premium payments. It is your responsibility to check this statement carefully and report any questionable deductions or mistakes to Human Resources at HR@kun.ai immediately.
