# Data Security & Data Leakage Prevention

During the length of projects with our clients we need to require employees to apply these policies in order to minimize exposure to risks.

## Data Security

First and foremost, Kunai builds systems, platforms, applications and products that facilitate data ingestion, process, manipulation, and distribution. Kunai and Kunaiâ€™s employees do not handle or store sensitive data and information about clients.

The way we build systems, platforms, applications and products is according to the best available standard of security following recommendations by organization like OWASP and PCI. For Developers, Within 90 days of your starting date you should complete the Security Training with Aaron and pass [OWASP Top 10 Exam](https://docs.google.com/a/kunaiconsulting.com/forms/d/1BZXDXAd2XN3YQBGPi_ivx8W8s_LBTI3WmY1qd-Y4ZCQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## Data Leakage Prevention

It is your responsibility to ensure the latest version of code is stored in the client's code repository and erase all code from projects you worked on within 30 days after the end of the project. 

In case of lost of stolen computer, immediately report the incident to Human Resources at HR@kun.ai.
