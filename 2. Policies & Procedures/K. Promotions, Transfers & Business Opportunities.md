# Promotions, Transfers & Business Opportunities

We support you on your evolutionary path! 

## Promotions 

A promotion occurs when an employee moves to a position that is at a higher salary grade.  Kunai encourages qualified employees to apply for open positions within our organization that would advance their professional careers or broaden the scope of their work experience. In addition to an employee applying for a new position, a favorable performance evaluation may lead to, but does not guarantee, a promotion or increase in salary. Salary increases and promotions are solely within the discretion of Kunai and depend upon many factors.

## Transfers

A transfer occurs when an employee moves to a position that is at the same, or sometimes lower, salary grade. Kunai recognizes that employee motivation, productivity, and retention are dependent upon people working in jobs that are well suited to their interests, and therefore offers and encourages internal transfer opportunities for employees. Likewise, Managers should be supportive of emplopyees who have the desire to enhance their skills or develop new competencies to pursue different or greater responsibilities internally.

To be eligible for transfer, an employee must:

- be in his or her current position at least nine (9) months
- be in good standing before he or she is eligible to apply for a transfer

The nine-month waiting requirement may be waived if the position is being adversely affected due to a reduction in the work force or job elimination, or if there is significant change in the terms and conditions of employment (e.g. work schedule, hours, salary, status, etc.).

In all cases, the employeeâ€™s work record, including but not limited to performance, attendance, efforts to develop skills and related behavior will be used as valid criteria for determining suitability for a position.

## Business Opportunities

Business opportunities could arise and the ones discovered through your work here belong first to Kunai, except as otherwise agreed to by Kunai. Avoid accepting employment, advisory positions, or board seats with Kunai competitors, clients or business partners when your judgment could be, or could appear to be, influenced in a way that could harm Kunai. Additionally, because board seats come with fiduciary obligations that can make them particularly tricky from a conflict of interest perspective, you should notify your manager or Human Resources at HR@kun.ai before accepting a board seat with any outside company or any other of the aforementioned opportunities.
