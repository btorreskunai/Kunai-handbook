# Promotions, Transfers & Business Opportunities

We support you on your evolutionary path! 

## Promotions 

Favorable performance evaluations may lead to, but do not guarantee, an increase in salary or a promotion. Salary increases and promotions are solely within the discretion of Kunai and depend upon many factors.

## Transfers

Kunai recognizes that employee motivation, productivity, and retention are dependent upon people working in jobs that are well suited to their interests, and therefore offers and encourages internal transfer opportunities for employees. Likewise, Managers should be supportive of emplopyees who have the desire to enhance their skills or develop new competencies to pursue different or greater responsibilities internally.

To be eligible for transfer, an employee must:

- be in his or her current position at least nine (9) months
- be in good standing before he or she is eligible to apply for a transfer

The nine-month waiting requirement may be waived if the position is being adversely affected due to a reduction in the work force or job elimination, or if there is significant change in the terms and conditions of employment (e.g. work schedule, hours, salary, status, etc.).

In all cases, the employeeâ€™s work record, including but not limited to performance, attendance, efforts to develop skills and related behavior will be used as valid criteria for determining suitability for a position.

## Business Opportunities

Business opportunities could arise and the ones discovered through your work here belong first to Kunai, except as otherwise agreed to by Kunai. Please discuss them with your Manager or Human Resources at HR@ku.nai.
