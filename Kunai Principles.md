# Kunai’s Principles

Principles are the means through which Kunai’s identity is codified. We evaluate decisions and consequences based on their alignment with our principles. These principles are character traits that are common to all individuals who work here; they are why individuals self-select themselves into our organization. Collectively, these principles constitute a key part of the blueprint for a successful organization.
 
## Latitude
We are an organization of responsible, self-organizing individuals. When work needs to get done, we quickly define roles, assign tasks and get to it.

We believe great work gets done when responsible people are brought together for a goal and are given the latitude to accomplish it however they see fit. We try to minimize rules in favor of flexibility.

We are performance oriented. We don't track hours or where you work from. 

 
## Self-Leadership
Self-leadership is having a developed sense of who you are, what you can do, and where you are going, coupled with the ability to influence your communication, emotions, and behavior on the way to getting there. Self-leaders are self-motivated to take purposeful action and therefore make better leaders and team members.
 
Self-leaders are constantly developing:
- *Self-awareness* - is about knowing your intentions and values, as well as knowing what can ‘push your buttons’ and derail you.
- *Self-confidence* - comes from knowing your strengths and abilities. As we take actions and develop skills, we become more confident.
- *Self-efficacy* - is the belief that whatever comes our way, we can handle it. We can take the feedback, accept, adjust and advance. With self-efficacy we can be more creative and innovative.
 
 
## Trust
We trust that information shared within the organization is frank. We don't shy away from difficult conversations. Giving and receiving feedback are skills that we have a responsibility to cultivate. Radical candor means respecting each other enough to provide feedback that will serve the other's growth and the benefit of the organization; this is how we operate.
 
## Systems Thinking
This is a rich area of ideas, but fundamentally systems thinking involves seeing the universe as a large system made up of other systems within it. A system is a group of related parts that work with each other in a pattern.
 
Kunai is an evolving system that exists to produce two primary outcomes:
1) customer value
2) the development of our people

We are continuously monitoring the operations of Kunai to more effectively produce these outcomes. 

Kunai is a system that is operating as a part in a larger system (the market). We are competing and cooperating with other systems. Kunai consists of parts, human and non-human. You are both part of this system, and a system yourself. Energy, resources, and information flow between systems and parts within systems. This flow is monitored and managed to produce desired outcomes.


## Growth
Great things take time and emerge through trial and error. Through iteration. We believe this about the products we build for our customers, and we believe this about ourselves. We're all a work in progress and want Kunai to be a place where you can evolve and develop towards a better version of yourself. We embrace experimentation and the beginner's mindset.
 
## Whole People
If you're stressed or overwhelmed, talk to someone about it. If you're unhappy with how something is going, voice your concerns. The more we know each other as whole people, the more fun we can have together. Stress is inevitable, but naming that stress and acknowledging it as a team can help to alleviate it and remind us of the bigger picture. We're in this together. If you're really distracted by something that's happening in your personal life, go ahead and bring that into your daily standup, or at least raise it with someone you're close with on the team.
