# Referral Bonus

Kunai is growing and order for us to take advantage of the opportunities in front of us we’re going to need more staff.

One of the main reasons we have found ourselves in this exciting position is because of our people - the calibre of talent and their cultural fits within Kunai. In fact, our team’s working style and attitude is what makes us successful and it’s really important that we preserve and cultivate this.

As such, we want to grow our team mainly, through our existing team - empowering you to have a say in who joins us, where possible, by recommending people through our Referral Program. This will formalize - and monetize (for you) - the process of you recommending talented and like-minded individuals. 

**Here’s how it works:**

* Think about who in your personal and professional network would be a good fit for the type of work we do at Kunai.
* Avoid selecting any members of staff at our clients.
* Have a conversation with them about Kunai, using your own experience. If you need some ideas on how to position us, we’ll share some materials with you. 
* If they would be interested in speaking with Kunai further, log their details on our [Kunai Referral Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5tJsFnyZUfUwozutVJl8aT_BkMsuZ4W0F6v0xOjvF0GKQAQ/viewform). Don’t log details of people that you haven’t explicitly talked to about Kunai.
* Your work is then done - we will use this input to create a pipeline of talent and match individuals to specific projects and needs.

We value your time and know that engaging people requires time and effort. As our appreciation of your time, if we hire someone that you recommended, we’ll compensate you with $1,500. If they are still at Kunai after 3 months, we’ll give you another $1,500 (this last component does not apply to contractors because of the temporary nature of the work).

Recruitment resources and tools can help us and will be used alongside referrals, but you truly know who would thrive at Kunai and many of you have fantastic networks of talent you could tap into. Let’s take Kunai to the next level!
