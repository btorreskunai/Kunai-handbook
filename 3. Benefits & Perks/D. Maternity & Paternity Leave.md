# Maternity & Paternity Leave

Kunai endorses the right of its employees to become parents. We are also aware that pregnancy or caring for an infant or a newly adopted child may cause difficulties for them in relation with their job duties. We are, therefore, prepared to support pregnant employees and allow new mothers and fathers enough time to recover from childbirth and/or care for their child.

The company will offer at least the minimum benefits mandated by law and this policy is merely complementary to the existing legal guidelines. The company may choose to provide employees with more time off for maternity/paternity reasons than the legal minimum. Such benefits will be explicitly stated in the offer letter or communicated afterwards in a written official manner. The company will abide by legislation and it will judge whether additional benefits should be offered.

Depending on legislation, an employee can begin their leave prior to or after the expected date of childbirth. In cases where a compulsory leave is legally applicable, the employee must strictly comply so the company will not be exposed to legal repercussions. All expecting employees can utilize reasonable paid time off for any kind of prenatal care including, but not limited to, medical examinations. 

All new parents can petition for an extension of unpaid maternity leave on grounds of medical or other reasons that are subject to companyâ€™s judgement (e.g. complications during pregnancy or childbirth may be cause for extension).

The positions of employees and the benefits associated with them will not be affected during the leave. The company is allowed during that time to fill the position with a temporary replacement.

An employee that has not requested extension or given other notice must return to their positions after the end of their leave. Not doing so is considered a voluntary resignation. Individual circumstances will be considered.

We will also take measures to help new mothers who return to work after the end of their maternity leave (e.g. by establishing flexible hours or work from home policies).

In the context of this policy and relevant legislation, adoption of a child is also grounds for requesting a maternity or paternity leave. Parents may need to utilize time off to meet appointments related to the adoption process or to bond with a recently adopted child. The same guidelines and procedure apply for these cases.

## Procedure
The expectant parent must adhere to the following procedure:

- Must give formal written notice to Supervisor and Human Resources about the pregnancy or adoption as soon as possible
- Must complete forms or submit a document stating the date of the expected child's arrival and the desired beginning date of leave
- Must arrange a meeting with Supervisor to agree on ways of keeping in touch (any arrangement should exclude any compulsory maternity or paternity leave)

The employee will be officially notified of the approval of leave request after eligibility under the law has been evaluated. Employees can view more information concerning [Paid Family Leave](https://www.edd.ca.gov/disability/paid_family_leave.htm) procedures or other queries.
