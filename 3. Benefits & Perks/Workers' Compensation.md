# Workers' Compensation

Workers' Compensation is a state-mandated benefit for workers injured on the job. The state-mandated workers' compensation benefits include, but are not limited to, medical treatment required to help recover from the effects of an injury or illness while in the workplace.

## What should you do if you get injured at work?**

Notify Human Resources, HR@kun.ai, as soon as possible so we can send you to the nearest Workers' Compensation clinic for evaluation and any necessary treatment. HR will initiate the claim filing process by calling TriNet (1-866-443-8489) to ensure the costs go through our Workers' Compensation insurance instead of coming out of your pocket.

## How are workers' compensation benefits paid for?**

The business pays a premium, and the insurance company pays for the benefits provided when a worker sustains a work injury.
