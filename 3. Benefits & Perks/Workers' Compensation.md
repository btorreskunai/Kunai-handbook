# Workers' Compensation

Workers' Compensation is a state-mandated benefit for workers injured on the job. The state-mandated workers' compensation benefits include, but are not limited to, medical treatment required to help recover from the effects of an injury or illness while in the workplace.

## How are workers' compensation benefits paid for?

The business pays a premium, and the insurance company pays for the benefits provided when a worker sustains a work injury.
