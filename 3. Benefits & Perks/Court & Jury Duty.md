# Court & Jury Duty

Kunai encourages employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities and will comply with relevant local, state, and federal laws. If you are called to appear in court, you should show your Supervisor written evidence, within 24 hours of receipt of such notice, indicating that you have been called for jury duty or subpoenaed to attend court or a coroner’s inquest.

If you are called to appear in court as described in this policy, you should present your Supervisor or Human Resources at HR@kun.ai with written evidence of the court’s notification to report as soon as it is received, preferably within 24 hours of receipt, as well as the anticipated period that you will be absent from work.

All court and jury duty days are covered under Kunai's unlimited paid time off policy, therefore your regular pay will not be affected.
