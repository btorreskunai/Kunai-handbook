## Bereavement Leave

Bereavement leave (or compassionate leave) is a type of paid time off given to employees when a member of their immediate family or a close friend dies. Bereavement leave is typically used to arrange a funeral or memorial service, attend a funeral or memorial service, resolve matters of inheritance, fulfill family obligations, and/or personal mourning.

In this policy, we define immediate family as spouses or domestic partners, all first degree relatives (parents, siblings and children), grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews. In-laws of the same types are included, as well as adopted parents, adopted children, legal guardians, half- and step-relatives.

Friends are also an important part of our lives and their loss may hurt as much as losing a relative. Should you lose a close friend, you’re still entitled to the same amount of bereavement leave to attend the funeral and mourn.

If you need to take bereavement leave, please inform management and Human Resources at HR@kun.ai as soon as possible. We do not require proof of death.

All bereavement days are covered under Kunai's unlimited paid time off policy, therefore your regular pay will not be affected.

## Jury Dury or Court Summons

Kunai encourages employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities and will comply with relevant local, state, and federal laws. If you are called to appear in court, you should show your Supervisor written evidence, within 24 hours of receipt of such notice, indicating that you have been called for jury duty or subpoenaed to attend court or a coroner’s inquest.

If you are called to appear in court as described in this policy, you should present your Supervisor or Human Resources at HR@kun.ai with written evidence of the court’s notification to report as soon as it is received, preferably within 24 hours of receipt, as well as the anticipated period that you will be absent from work.

All court and jury duty days are covered under Kunai's unlimited paid time off policy, therefore your regular pay will not be affected.
