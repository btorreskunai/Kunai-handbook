## Maternity & Paternity Leave

Kunai endorses the right of its employees to become parents. We are also aware that pregnancy or caring for an infant or a newly adopted child may cause difficulties for them in relation with their job duties. We are, therefore, prepared to support pregnant employees and allow new mothers and fathers enough time to recover from childbirth and/or care for their child.

The company will offer at least the minimum benefits mandated by law and this policy is merely complementary to the existing legal guidelines. The company may choose to provide employees with more time off for maternity/paternity reasons than the legal minimum. Such benefits will be explicitly stated in the offer letter or communicated afterwards in a written official manner. The company will abide by legislation and it will judge whether additional benefits should be offered.

Depending on legislation, an employee can begin their leave prior to or after the expected date of childbirth. In cases where a compulsory leave is legally applicable, the employee must strictly comply so the company will not be exposed to legal repercussions. All expecting employees can utilize reasonable paid time off for any kind of prenatal care including, but not limited to, medical examinations.

All new parents can petition for an extension of unpaid maternity leave on grounds of medical or other reasons that are subject to company’s judgement (e.g. complications during pregnancy or childbirth may be cause for extension).

The positions of employees and the benefits associated with them will not be affected during the leave. The company is allowed during that time to fill the position with a temporary replacement.

An employee that has not requested extension or given other notice must return to their positions after the end of their leave. Not doing so is considered a voluntary resignation. Individual circumstances will be considered.

We will also take measures to help new mothers who return to work after the end of their maternity leave (e.g. by establishing flexible hours or work from home policies).

In the context of this policy and relevant legislation, adoption of a child is also grounds for requesting a maternity or paternity leave. Parents may need to utilize time off to meet appointments related to the adoption process or to bond with a recently adopted child. The same guidelines and procedure apply for these cases.

### Procedure

The expectant parent must adhere to the following procedure:

- Must give formal written notice to Supervisor and Human Resources about the pregnancy or adoption as soon as possible
- Must complete forms or submit a document stating the date of the expected child's arrival and the desired beginning date of leave
- Must arrange a meeting with Supervisor to agree on ways of keeping in touch (any arrangement should exclude any compulsory maternity or paternity leave)

The employee will be officially notified of the approval of leave request after eligibility under the law has been evaluated. Employees can view more information concerning [Paid Family Leave](https://www.edd.ca.gov/disability/paid_family_leave.htm) procedures or other queries.

## Bereavement Leave

Bereavement leave (or compassionate leave) is a type of paid time off given to employees when a member of their immediate family or a close friend dies. Bereavement leave is typically used to arrange a funeral or memorial service, attend a funeral or memorial service, resolve matters of inheritance, fulfill family obligations, and/or personal mourning.

In this policy, we define immediate family as spouses or domestic partners, all first degree relatives (parents, siblings and children), grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews. In-laws of the same types are included, as well as adopted parents, adopted children, legal guardians, half- and step-relatives.

Friends are also an important part of our lives and their loss may hurt as much as losing a relative. Should you lose a close friend, you’re still entitled to the same amount of bereavement leave to attend the funeral and mourn.

If you need to take bereavement leave, please inform management and Human Resources at HR@kun.ai as soon as possible. We do not require proof of death.

All bereavement days are covered under Kunai's unlimited paid time off policy, therefore your regular pay will not be affected.

## Jury Dury or Court Summons

Kunai encourages employees to fulfill their civic responsibilities and will comply with relevant local, state, and federal laws. If you are called to appear in court, you should show your Supervisor written evidence, within 24 hours of receipt of such notice, indicating that you have been called for jury duty or subpoenaed to attend court or a coroner’s inquest.

If you are called to appear in court as described in this policy, you should present your Supervisor or Human Resources at HR@kun.ai with written evidence of the court’s notification to report as soon as it is received, preferably within 24 hours of receipt, as well as the anticipated period that you will be absent from work.

All court and jury duty days are covered under Kunai's unlimited paid time off policy, therefore your regular pay will not be affected.

## Other Leaves of Absence

Any other extended absences will be addressed as they arise. Kunai will comply with all minimum legal requirements.
