## Bereavement Leave

Bereavement leave (or compassionate leave) is a type of paid time off given to employees when a member of their immediate family or a close friend dies. Bereavement leave is typically used to arrange a funeral or memorial service, attend a funeral or memorial service, resolve matters of inheritance, fulfill family obligations, and/or personal mourning.

In this policy, we define immediate family as spouses or domestic partners, all first degree relatives (parents, siblings and children), grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews. In-laws of the same types are included, as well as adopted parents, adopted children, legal guardians, half- and step-relatives.

Friends are also an important part of our lives and their loss may hurt as much as losing a relative. Should you lose a close friend, youâ€™re still entitled to the same amount of bereavement leave to attend the funeral and mourn.

If you need to take bereavement leave, please inform management and Human Resources at HR@kun.ai as soon as possible. We do not require proof of death.

All bereavement days are covered under Kunai's unlimited paid time off policy, therefore your regular pay will not be affected.
