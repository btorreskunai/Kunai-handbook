# Paid Time Off (PTO)

## Policy Brief & Purpose
Kunai's PTO policy allows employees to take as much vacation or sick leave as they need. Employees need time to rest and enjoy themselves outside of work - we all need it. Putting a cap on this important time does not help our effort to achieve high levels of employee satisfaction and productivity.

This policy is based on mutual trust between Kunai and its employees. It gives employees opportunities to work or take time off as they see fit, as long as they continue to fulfill their duties. The company will review this policy annually and address any concerns.

## Scope
This policy applies to full-time employees of the company.

## Policy Elements
The company does not limit and does not track the amount of PTO employees take. As employees do not accrue time off, Kunai will not compensate unused leave. This policy doesn’t interfere with legally established leaves like maternity and paternity leave. Employees should use at least the legal amount. Any vacation leave they choose to take is separate.

## Procedure
Failing to abide by the following proper PTO procedures may result in repercussions on bonus and employement overall with Kuani. To avoid any negative repercussions, employees are obliged to:

- Avoid abusing the policy by taking time off that negatively impacts their job and the company.
- Communicate and collaborate with their team to ensure everyone takes leave without disrupting operations.
- Plan to delegate, postpone or otherwise manage projects that will be affected by their time off.
- Notify their Product Manager or Supervisor with a minimum notice equivalent to double the number of days you are taking off. *For example: If you are taking one week off, then you need to inform your PM or Supervisor at least 2 weeks in advance.*
- Input your Out-of-Office (OOO) into the vacation calendar.

## PTO Rejections

Supervisors can consider rejecting PTO requests if:

- Other team members with similar or complementary duties have already asked for leave during the same time.
- The time in question is too busy or includes an important deadline for the employee asking for leave.
- An employee appears to abuse the policy. Supervisors have to prove that this is the case, using data presenting employees’ inadequate deliverables. They should also arrange a meeting with the employee and Human Resources.

Supervisors cannot reject PTO requests for any of the following reasons:

- To discipline employees.
- To force employees to fulfil duties that aren’t urgent.
- To approve leave for another employee who made a later request.

Neither list is exhaustive. Both employees and supervisors should use common sense and adhere to company policies when requesting/approving vacation leave. Effective communication between team members is vital to make this policy work for everyone.
