# Pets
We love pets, who doesnâ€™t. However it can become stressful for people to work with your lovely python crawling around (the one that eats mice, not SQLite). We would accommodate that on a case to case basis. Please ask HR: HR@kunaiconsulting.com to get your pet approved. Keep in mind you are responsible for keeping the space clean and supervise the behavior of your eventually approved pet.
