# Data Security Policy
First and foremost, Kunai build systems, platforms, applications and products that facilitate data ingestion, process, manipulation and distribution. Kunai and Kunaiâ€™s employees do not handle or store sensitive data and information about clients.

The way we build systems, platforms, applications and products is according to the best available standard of security (@aaron some examples would be great)
