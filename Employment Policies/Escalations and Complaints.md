# Escalations and Complaints
Internal escalations of any issues should be made by employees to their line managers, in writing. If unresolved between the employee and manager over a period of one week, this should be escalated to the next level of management. If still unresolved over a period of two further weeks, this should be brought to the attention of HR: HR@kunaiconsulting.com and formally logged within the complaint policy.

Any formal complaint about Kunai or one of its employees or third party contractors should be logged within the complaint table shown below. All columns must be completed and a mitigation call will take place between the complaint owner and senior management each week until a resolution is reached.

| Date | Complaint | Complaint from | Received by | Nature of complaint | Complaint directed at | Kunai owner | Next steps | Follow up notes | Status
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8/3/17 | Example | Client A | Olly Jones | Poor project management | PM 123 | Olly Jones | Formal client review | Complaint validated, PM changed on account | Unresolved
