# Code of Professional Conduct
When we talk about Engineering Success, we are also talking about how to build your own success, not just Kunai’s.
We want Kunai to be the platform for you to engineer your success and to enable the success of your engineering.
In order to ‘engineer’ it, there are elements and subcomponents to take into consideration, kind of min requirements: respect the law, treat coworkers, partners, clients with kindness and respect, always.
Some of these subcomponents help condensing our Principles into practical standards of business conduct.
Keep each other accountable on this and as the MTA always tell us: “if you see something say something!”
### Who should follow the code?
Every employee, contractor, partner, member of the board, everybody that represents Kunai.
### Who should I contact if I have questions or concerns?
code@kunaiconsulting.com 
### No Retaliation
Retaliation against any worker who reports or participates in an investigation of a possible violation of our Code, policies, or the law, is prohibited. If you believe you are being retaliated against, please contact code@kunaiconsulting.com 

### Compliance with law
All employees must protect our company’s legality. They should comply with all environmental, safety and fair dealing laws. We expect employees to be ethical and responsible when dealing with our company’s finances, products, partnerships and public image.

### We serve our customers
Kunai exists because we help clients. They trust us with their data, processes and with their strategy to become better in serving their own customers with our support. That’s a big responsibility. To fulfill this responsibility we need to keep ourselves accountable on the highest standards:
1.	Integrity. 
    Our reputation as a company that our users can trust is our most valuable asset, and it is up to all of us to make sure that we continually earn that trust. All of our communications and other interactions with our users should increase their trust in us.
2.	Privacy and Security. 
    Always remember that we are asking client to trust us with their data. Preserving that trust requires that each of us respect and protect the privacy and security of that information. Our security procedures strictly limit access to and use of clients’ data, and require that each of us take measures to protect clients’ data from unauthorized access. Know your responsibilities under these procedures, and collect, use, and access user personal information only as authorized by our [Security Policies](https://github.com/kunai-consulting/handbook/blob/master/Employment%20Policies/Employee%20Privacy.md), our `Privacy Policies`, and applicable data protection laws.
3.	Responsiveness. 
Part of being useful and honest is being responsive: We recognize relevant feedback when we see it, and we do something about it. We take pride in responding to communications from our clients and partners, whether questions, problems, or compliments. If something is broken, fix it.


### We are a part of a whole: Kunai
We are committed to a supportive work environment, where employees have the opportunity to reach their fullest potential `[Alex to add something linked to Principles: evolutionary process]`. Each of us is expected to do his or her utmost to create a workplace culture that is free of harassment, intimidation, bias, and unlawful discrimination.

1.	Equal Opportunity Employment. 
Employment here is based solely upon individual merit and qualifications directly related to professional competence. We strictly prohibit unlawful discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, veteran status, national origin, ancestry, pregnancy status, sex, gender identity or expression, age, marital status, mental or physical disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, or any other characteristics protected by law. We also make all reasonable accommodations to meet our obligations under laws protecting the rights of the disabled.
2.	Harassment, Discrimination, and Bullying. 
Kunai prohibits discrimination, harassment and bullying in any form – verbal, physical, or visual. If you believe you’ve been bullied or harassed by anyone at Kunai, or by a Kunai partner or vendor, we strongly encourage you to immediately report the incident to your supervisor. Similarly, supervisors and managers who learn of any such incident should immediately report it to the compliance officer: code@kunaiconsulting.com. We will promptly and thoroughly investigate any complaints and take appropriate action.
3.	Drugs and Alcohol. Our position on substance abuse is simple: It is incompatible with the health and safety of our employees, and we don’t permit it. Consumption of alcohol is not banned at our offices, but use good judgment and never drink in a way that leads to impaired performance or inappropriate behavior, endangers the safety of others, or violates the law. Illegal drugs in our offices or at sponsored events are strictly prohibited. If a manager has reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee’s use of drugs and/or alcohol may adversely affect the employee’s job performance or the safety of the employee or others in the workplace, the manager may request an alcohol and/or drug screening. A reasonable suspicion may be based on objective symptoms such as the employee’s appearance, behavior, or speech.
4.	Safe workplace. 
We are committed to a violence-free work environment, and we will not tolerate any level of violence or the threat of violence in the workplace. Under no circumstances should anyone bring a weapon to work. If you become aware of a violation of this policy, you should report it to to the compliance officer: code@kunaiconsulting.com immediately.
5.	Pet policy. 
We love pets, who doesn’t. However it can become stressful for people to work with you lovely python crawling around (the one that eat mice, not SQLite). We would accommodate that on a case to case basis. Keep in mind you are responsible for keeping the space clean and supervise the behavior of your eventually approved pet.

### Avoid Conflict of Interest
When you are in a situation in which competing loyalties could cause you to pursue a personal benefit for you, your friends, or your family at the expense of Kunai or our clients, you may be faced with a conflict of interest. All of us should avoid conflicts of interest and circumstances that reasonably present the appearance of a conflict.
When considering a course of action, ask yourself whether the action you’re considering could create an incentive for you, or appear to others to create an incentive for you, to benefit yourself, your friends or family, or an associated business at the expense of Kunai. If the answer is “yes,” the action you’re considering is likely to create a conflict of interest situation, and you should avoid it.

Below, we provide guidance in seven areas where conflicts of interest often arise:

1.	Use of Kunai resources. 
In each of these situations, the rule is the same – if you are considering entering into a business situation that creates a conflict of interest, don’t. If you are in a business situation that may create a conflict of interest, or the appearance of a conflict of interest, review the situation with your manager and the compliance officer. Finally, it’s important to understand that as circumstances change, a situation that previously didn’t present a conflict of interest may present one.
2.	Personal investments. 
Avoid making personal investments in companies that are Kunai’s clients or business partners when the investment might cause, or appear to cause, you to act in a way that could harm Kunai. When determining whether a personal investment creates a conflict of interest, consider the relationship between the business of the outside company, our business, and what you do at Kunai, including whether the company has a business relationship with Kunai that you can influence. You should also consider whether the information you acquired working for Kunai gives you an advantage over what is public available. If the answer is yes, you might have a conflict of interest and you should discuss this with your manager or compliance officer.
3.	Outside Employment, Advisory Roles, Board Seats, and Starting Your Own Business. Avoid accepting employment, advisory positions, or board seats with Kunai competitors, clients or business partners when your judgment could be, or could appear to be, influenced in a way that could harm Kunai. Additionally, because board seats come with fiduciary obligations that can make them particularly tricky from a conflict of interest perspective, you should notify your manager before accepting a board seat with any outside company. Finally, do not start your own business if it will compete with Kunai.
4.	Business Opportunities Found Through Work. 
We support you in your evolutionary path. Business opportunities could arise and the ones discovered through your work here belong first to Kunai, except as otherwise agreed to by Kunai. Please discuss them with your manager or compliance officer.
5.	Inventions. 
Developing or helping to develop outside inventions that a) relate to Kunai’s existing or reasonably anticipated products and services, b) relate to your position at Kunai, or c) are developed using Kunai corporate resources may create conflicts of interest and be subject to the provisions of `Kunai’s Confidential Information` and `Invention Assignment Agreement` and other employment agreements. If you have any questions about potential conflicts or intellectual property ownership involving an outside invention or other intellectual property, consult your manager or compliance officer.
6.	Friends and Relatives; Co-Worker Relationships. Avoid participating in management of or decision-making regarding potential or existing Kunai business relationships that involve your relatives, spouse or significant other, or close friends. This includes being the hiring manager for a position for which your relative or close friend is being considered or being a relationship manager for a company associated with your spouse or significant other. To be clear, just because a relative, spouse/significant other, or close friend works at Kunai or becomes a Kunai competitor or business partner doesn’t mean there is a conflict of interest. However, if you are also involved in that Kunai business relationship, it can be very sensitive. The right thing to do in that situation is to discuss the relationship with your manager.
7.	Business Gifts, Entertainment. 
Accepting gifts, entertainment, and other business courtesies from a Kunai’s client, competitor or business partner can easily create the appearance of a conflict of interest, especially if the value of the item is significant. Generally, acceptance of inexpensive “token” non-cash gifts is permissible. In addition, infrequent and moderate business meals and entertainment with clients and infrequent invitations to attend local sporting events and celebratory meals with clients can be appropriate aspects of many business relationships, provided that they aren’t excessive and don’t create the appearance of impropriety. Before accepting any gift or courtesy that is significant, be aware that you may need to obtain manager approval.
