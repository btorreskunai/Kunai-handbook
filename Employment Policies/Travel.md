Keep receipts over $25
When expensing a meal for multiple people, keep a list of attendees
Submit expenses (using attached TBD) to ap@kunaiconsulting.com and your manager in order to get approval and reimbursed
Reimbursements will happen within 30 days of approval
If in doubt about any expense, use common sense and double check with your manager
