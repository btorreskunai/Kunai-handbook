Trip Approval
Always obtain manager approval for a trip, on email or slack, by sending them business purpose and estimated cost of trip, broken down into car/train/air/hotel/meals/other categories

Expenses
Keep copies of all receipts over $25, at least until your expenses have been reimbursed to you
When expensing a meal for multiple people, keep a list of attendees

Reimbursements will happen within 30 days of approval of expense submission
