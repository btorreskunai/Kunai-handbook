# Personal investments
Avoid making personal investments in companies that are Kunaiâ€™s clients or business partners when the investment might cause, or appear to cause, you to act in a way that could harm Kunai. When determining whether a personal investment creates a conflict of interest, consider the relationship between the business of the outside company, our business, and what you do at Kunai, including whether the company has a business relationship with Kunai that you can influence. You should also consider whether the information you acquired working for Kunai gives you an advantage over what is public available. If the answer is yes, you might have a conflict of interest and you should discuss this with your manager or compliance officer.
