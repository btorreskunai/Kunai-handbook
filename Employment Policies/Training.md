# Employee Development
Our Employee Development company policy refers to the company’s learning and development programs and activities. In the modern competitive environment, employees need to replenish their knowledge and acquire new skills to do their jobs better. This will benefit both them and the company. We want them to feel confident about improving efficiency and productivity, as well as finding new ways towards personal development and success.

This policy applies to all permanent, full-time or part-time, employees of the company. Employees with temporary/short-term contracts might attend trainings at their manager’s discretion. This policy doesn’t cover supplementary employees like contractors or consultants.

Employees, managers and Human Resources (HR) should all collaborate to build a continuous professional development (CPD) culture. It’s an employee’s responsibility to seek new learning opportunities. It’s a manager’s responsibility to coach their teams and identify employee development needs.

In general, we approve and encourage the following employee trainings: Formal training sessions (individual or corporate), Employee Coaching and Mentoring, Participating in conferences, On-the-job training, Job shadowing.
As a rule-of-thumb we will reimburse up to $1,000 per calendar year per employee on approved trainings.

As part of our learning and development provisions, we can also arrange for subscriptions or educational material, so employees will have access to news, articles and other material that can help them become better at their job, upon approval by employee’s manager.

All trainings should consider what employees need and how they can learn best. This is why, we encourage employees and managers to consider multiple training methods like workshops, e-learning, lectures and more.

We might occasionally engage experts to train our employees. The company will cover the entire cost in this case.

Employees should show willingness to improve by asking their managers for direction and advice. Managers should do the same with their own superiors, while encouraging and mentoring their subordinates. Employees and managers are responsible for finding the best ways to CPD. They can experiment with job rotation, job shadowing and other types of on-the-job training (without disrupting daily operations). We also encourage employees to use their rights for self-paced learning by asking for educational material and access to other resources. All eligible employees are covered by this policy without discriminating against rank or protected characteristics. Managers should evaluate the success of training efforts. They should keep records for reference and better improvement opportunities. All employee development efforts should respect cost and time limitations, as well as individual and business needs. Employees should try to make the most out of their trainings by studying and finding ways to apply knowledge to their work.
