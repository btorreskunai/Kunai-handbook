# Gifts and Entertainment
Accepting gifts, entertainment, and other business courtesies from a Kunai client, competitor or business partner can easily create the appearance of a conflict of interest, especially if the value of the item is significant. Generally, acceptance of inexpensive “token” non-cash gifts is permissible. In addition, infrequent and moderate business meals and entertainment with clients and infrequent invitations to attend local sporting events and celebratory meals with clients can be appropriate aspects of many business relationships, provided that they aren’t excessive and don’t create the appearance of impropriety. Before accepting any gift or courtesy that is significant, be aware that you may need to obtain manager approval.
