# Performance Evaluation
Kunai’s Annual Performance Review process has been designed to provide a vital link between the organization’s Business Plan, its vision and guiding principles, and individual staff members. It is also designed to ensure that goals and objectives flow from the top of the organization to the personal objectives of each individual. It is integral to fostering an engaged and productive workforce, recognizing and rewarding good performance, and managing underperformance.

This Policy applies to permanent and part-time paid employees only. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that a consistent approach is followed for conducting Annual Performance Reviews, and that job-related skill and knowledge, and employee competencies and behaviors, are evaluated and compared against set standards and business objectives.

During the first month of an employee’s commencement in a role, Managers will work with the employee to develop a Performance Plan which will be updated during the Financial Year Period. The Performance Plan will outline the employee’s goals and objectives for a 12-month period in line with the organization’s Business Plan.

Similarly, a Development Plan will outline the individual’s development priorities for the following 12-month period, as well as reviewing any for the previous 12 months.  Consideration should also be given to the individual’s long-term career objectives.

Managers will conduct a formal Annual Performance Review with each employee within the first six weeks of the new financial year. Progress reviews may be conducted on an informal basis more frequently throughout the financial year.

Periodic assessment and discussion of performance will be carried out throughout the course of the review period between Managers and each of their employees on an “as needed” basis.
