# Co-Worker Relationships
Avoid participating in management of or decision-making regarding potential or existing Kunai business relationships that involve your relatives, spouse or significant other, or close friends. This includes being the hiring manager for a position for which your relative or close friend is being considered or being a relationship manager for a company associated with your spouse or significant other. To be clear, just because a relative, spouse/significant other, or close friend works at Kunai or becomes a Kunai competitor or business partner doesnâ€™t mean there is a conflict of interest. However, if you are also involved in that Kunai business relationship, it can be very sensitive. The right thing to do in that situation is to discuss the relationship with your manager and/or HR: HR@kunaiconsulting.com.
