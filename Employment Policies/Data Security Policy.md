# Data Security Policy
First and foremost, Kunai builds systems, platforms, applications and products that facilitate data ingestion, process, manipulation and distribution. Kunai and Kunaiâ€™s employees do not handle or store sensitive data and information about clients.

The way we build systems, platforms, applications and products is according to the best available standard of security (@aaron some examples would be great)

Within 90 days of your starting date you should complete the Security Training with Aaron and pass the test (@aaron to add more info)

During the length of projects with our clients we need to require employees to apply these policies in order to minimize exposure to risks:

You should also refer to our policies on:
* [Work Equipment](https://github.com/kunai-consulting/handbook/blob/master/Employment%20Policies/Work%20Equipment.md)
* [Data Leakage Prevention](https://github.com/kunai-consulting/handbook/blob/master/Employment%20Policies/Data%20Leakage%20Prevention.md)
