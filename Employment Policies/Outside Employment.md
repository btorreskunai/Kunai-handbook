# Outside Employment, Advisory Roles, Board Seats and Starting Your Own Business
Avoid accepting employment, advisory positions, or board seats with Kunai competitors, clients or business partners when your judgment could be, or could appear to be, influenced in a way that could harm Kunai. Additionally, because board seats come with fiduciary obligations that can make them particularly tricky from a conflict of interest perspective, you should notify your manager before accepting a board seat with any outside company.
