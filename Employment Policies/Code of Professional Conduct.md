# Code of Professional Conduct
When we talk about Engineering Success, we are also talking about how to build your own success, not just Kunai’s.
We want Kunai to be the platform for you to engineer your success and to enable the success of your engineering.
In order to ‘engineer’ it, there are elements and subcomponents to take into consideration, kind of min requirements: respect the law, treat coworkers, partners, clients with kindness and respect, always.
Some of these subcomponents help condensing our Principles into practical standards of business conduct.
Keep each other accountable on this and as the MTA always tell us: “if you see something say something!”

### Who should follow the code?
Every employee, contractor, partner, member of the board, everybody that represents Kunai.
### Who should I contact if I have questions or concerns?
For any questions or concerns contact HR: HR@kunaiconsulting.com
### No Retaliation
Retaliation against any worker who reports or participates in an investigation of a possible violation of our Code, policies, or the law, is prohibited. If you believe you are being retaliated against, please contact HR: HR@kunaiconsulting.com

### Compliance with law
All employees must protect our company’s legality. They should comply with all environmental, safety and fair dealing laws. We expect employees to be ethical and responsible when dealing with our company’s finances, products, partnerships and public image.

### We serve our customers
Kunai exists because we help clients. They trust us with their data, processes and with their strategy to become better in serving their own customers with our support. That’s a big responsibility. To fulfill this responsibility we need to keep ourselves accountable on the highest standards:
1.	Integrity.
    Our reputation as a company that our users can trust is our most valuable asset, and it is up to all of us to make sure that we continually earn that trust. All of our communications and other interactions with our users should increase their trust in us.
2.	Privacy and Security.
    Always remember that we are asking client to trust us with their data. Preserving that trust requires that each of us respect and protect the privacy and security of that information. Our security procedures strictly limit access to and use of clients’ data, and require that each of us take measures to protect clients’ data from unauthorized access. Know your responsibilities under these procedures, and collect, use, and access user personal information only as authorized by our [Data Security Policy](https://github.com/kunai-consulting/handbook/blob/master/Employment%20Policies/Data%20Security.md), our [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/kunai-consulting/handbook/blob/master/Employment%20Policies/Employee%20Privacy.md), and applicable data protection laws.
3.	Responsiveness.
Part of being useful and honest is being responsive: We recognize relevant feedback when we see it, and we do something about it. We take pride in responding to communications from our clients and partners, whether questions, problems, or compliments. If something is broken, fix it.


### We are a part of a whole: Kunai
We are committed to a supportive work environment, where employees have the opportunity to reach their fullest potential. FOr more on this see our [Principles](https://github.com/kunai-consulting/handbook/blob/master/Kunai%20Principles.md). Each of us is expected to do his or her utmost to create a workplace culture that is free of harassment, intimidation, bias, and unlawful discrimination.

### Avoid Conflict of Interest
When you are in a situation in which competing loyalties could cause you to pursue a personal benefit for you, your friends, or your family at the expense of Kunai or our clients, you may be faced with a conflict of interest. All of us should avoid conflicts of interest and circumstances that reasonably present the appearance of a conflict.
When considering a course of action, ask yourself whether the action you’re considering could create an incentive for you, or appear to others to create an incentive for you, to benefit yourself, your friends or family, or an associated business at the expense of Kunai. If the answer is “yes,” the action you’re considering is likely to create a conflict of interest situation, and you should avoid it.

Below, we provide guidance in areas where conflicts of interest often arise. In each of these situations, the rule is the same – if you are considering entering into a business situation that creates a conflict of interest, don’t. If you are in a business situation that may create a conflict of interest, or the appearance of a conflict of interest, review the situation with your manager and the compliance officer. Finally, it’s important to understand that as circumstances change, a situation that previously didn’t present a conflict of interest may present one.
