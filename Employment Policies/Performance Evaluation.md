# Performance Evaluation
At Kunai we pride ourselves on maintaining an extremely transparent and collaborative workplace. This frequently leads to on the spot feedback and challenges to approaches and ideas - all in the name of making us better collectively and individually. In fact, our employees will often seek it out feedback if they think there's room for even the slightest improvement in their approach.
We believe this is a fundamental driver of our ability to deliver such high quality work. Its important to us that we employ and work with people who have the right attitude to thrive in this environment - both giving and receiving feedback and improvement ideas. For more on this please also check our [Principles](https://github.com/kunai-consulting/handbook/blob/master/Kunai%20Principles.md)

As much as we try to avoid it, there will be times when an employee either isn't the right fit for this culture or is having other continual problems with performing at the level we expect. In these situations, we again remain transparent and will openly look to help the individual find a different role either inside or outside of Kunai.

In our short history we have not had to deal with any severe disciplinary cases, but our employment framework is set in such away that immediate dismissal could be triggered - we hope to continue to not use this.

Kunai’s Annual Performance Review process has been designed to provide a vital link between the organization’s Business Plan, its vision and guiding principles, and individual staff members. It is also designed to ensure that goals and objectives flow from the top of the organization to the personal objectives of each individual. It is integral to fostering an engaged and productive workforce, recognizing and rewarding good performance, and managing underperformance.

This Policy applies to all full-time paid employees. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that a consistent approach is followed for conducting Annual Performance Reviews, and that job-related skill and knowledge, and employee competencies and behaviors, are evaluated and compared against set standards and business objectives.

Managers will work with the employee to define a Development Plan (part of the Performance Evaluation) which will be updated during the  Year. The Development Plan will outline the employee’s goals and objectives for a 12-month period in line with the organization’s Business Plan and how we can help and support the employee in his/her own development. Consideration should also be given to the individual’s long-term career objectives.

Managers will have at least two meetings with the employees about their Performance Evaluation. Progress reviews may be conducted on an informal basis more frequently throughout the financial year.

Periodic assessment and discussion of performance will be carried out throughout the course of the review period between Managers and each of their employees on an “as needed” basis.
