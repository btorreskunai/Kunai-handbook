# Performance Evaluation
Kunai’s Annual Performance Review process has been designed to provide a vital link between the organization’s Business Plan, its vision and guiding principles, and individual staff members. It is also designed to ensure that goals and objectives flow from the top of the organization to the personal objectives of each individual. It is integral to fostering an engaged and productive workforce, recognizing and rewarding good performance, and managing underperformance.

This Policy applies to permanent and part-time paid employees only. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that a consistent approach is followed for conducting Annual Performance Reviews, and that job-related skill and knowledge, and employee competencies and behaviors, are evaluated and compared against set standards and business objectives.

Managers will work with the employee to define a Development Plan (part of the Performance Evaluation) which will be updated during the  Year. The Development Plan will outline the employee’s goals and objectives for a 12-month period in line with the organization’s Business Plan and how we can help and support the employee in his/her own development. Consideration should also be given to the individual’s long-term career objectives.

Managers will have at least two meetings with the employees about their Performace Evaluation. Progress reviews may be conducted on an informal basis more frequently throughout the financial year.

Periodic assessment and discussion of performance will be carried out throughout the course of the review period between Managers and each of their employees on an “as needed” basis.
