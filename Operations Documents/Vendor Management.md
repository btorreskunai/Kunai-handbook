# Vendor Management
The purpose of the Vendor Management Policy is to provide written guidelines surrounding the procurement of third party services and products in accordance with the Kunai’s mission, obligations, and ongoing business.

Kunai utilizes vendors to provide services and products for the benefit of the business. Vendors include but are not limited to contractors, venues, financial institutions, software providers, office supplies etc. Kunai utilizes some one-time vendors and some vendor relationships are ongoing. Due diligence, particularly for vendor engagements exceeding $15,000, is necessary to limit the risk of financial loss or reputational harm to Kunai. Depending on the size and scope of services or products needed, the procurement of vendors may also include the solicitation of bids, execution of a contract, and down payments.

Due diligence may include but is not limited to speaking with the vendor or vendor’s agent, reviewing the vendor’s website, reading reviews of the vendor or product, soliciting input from Senior Management or other individuals with experience with the vendor or product, etc.

For service engagements, generally of $15,000 or more, such as event planning, sound, venues, and food services, the due diligence process should also include the solicitation of bids from multiple providers whenever possible at a minimum of every (3) years for on-going relationships.

Contracts, whenever possible, should be forwarded to Senior Management prior to execution for review and approval.

Contracts in excess of $50,000 shall be considered for review by an attorney.

Executed Contracts shall be retained by the Finance Department
